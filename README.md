# Introduction
A guesthouse booking system is a software application that enables guesthouses and small hotels to manage their reservations, guest information, and room availability. Our guesthouse booking system is integrated with the management system where we can manage the inventory, view and update the staff details, grant/reject staff leave requests, update staff’s salary and schedule and even contact suppliers for inventories.


# Need for this Project

● Prone to Errors: Manual systems are highly susceptible to human errors, including double bookings, incorrect data entry, or miscommunication, leading to guest dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies.

● Time-Consuming: Manually managing bookings, updating availability, and handling guest information is time-consuming.

● Ineffective Reporting and Analysis: Generating reports or analyzing booking trends manually is cumbersome. Lack of real-time data and insights makes it difficult for guesthouses to make informed decisions for marketing strategies, pricing, or resource allocation.

● Reduced Guest Experience: Manual systems may lead to slower check-in/check-out processes, longer waiting times, or inaccuracies in guest information, impacting the overall guest experience negatively.

● Limited Scalability: As the guesthouse grows, manual systems struggle to handle increased bookings and operations. Managing a larger volume of guests becomes challenging without an automated system in place.

● Inventory Management:Manual recording of inventory levels is prone to errors such as miscounts, misplaced items, or incorrect entries, leading to discrepancies in stock levels.

● Scheduling Challenges: Creating staff schedules manually can be complex and time-consuming, leading to inefficiencies, conflicts, or understaffing/overstaffing situations.



# Features
1. The system should be able to take bookings from various online channels. These online channels should show the booking status of all the rooms accurately.
2. The system should accurately display the rooms which are available and the rooms which are booked/reserved to the authorized personnel of the guest house.
3. The Customers should be able to book rooms from the various booking channels available. He/she should also be able to book the rooms offline.
4. Implementation of a database for all the inventory of the guest house for proper management.
5. The system should have staff scheduling/management features so that the admin/owner can keep track of the staff.
6. The system should generate monthly statistics related to the revenue, peak booking seasons, etc which will help the guest house manage its resources efficiently. It will show the performance of the guest house.
7. The customer should be able to make payments in online mode. The payment method used should be safe and secure.
8. The customer should be able to give reviews to the guesthouse and the guest house should be able to view all the reviews given to them. This will help the guesthouse improve their services and it will also help other customers to get an idea about their services.
9. System on the guest house side should have hierarchical login. The staff cannot access the features exclusive to the manager/receptionist and the receptionist cannot access the features exclusive to the owner/admin.
